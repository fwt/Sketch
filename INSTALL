   INSTALLATION
------------------

In order to install Sketch you need eyeOS version 2.0 or
higher. You can download it at http://www.eyeos.org/.

1. Copy the contents of the "extern" folder into the
   "extern" subfolder of your eyeOS main folder. This
   folder contains the icons used by Sketch. Change the
   file permissions, so that your webserver can read these
   files.

2. Go to the "apps" subfolder of your eyeOS main folder and
   create a new folder called "sketch". Copy the contents
   of the "src" folder into the newly created "sketch"
   folder. Change the file permissions, so that your
   webserver can read these files.

3. Make sure your eyeOS server has ImageMagick installed.
   Otherwise your can get it from
   http://www.imagemagick.org/.

4. Launch eyeOS in your favourite SVG 1.1 compatible
   browser and start Sketch from the "Applications" menu.
   Happy sketching!
